# February 17th 2024 Music Making Day


We will bring singers and instrumentalists together for a Making Music Day to be hekd at Falkirk Trinity Church, Manse Place, Falkirk FK1 1JN from 10.30am til 4pm on Saturday February 17th 2024. Led by Michael Cameron-Lomgden and Lynne Hope, we will be looking at some delightful choruses from some of Purcell's operas and (depending on the mix of instruments) some other surprise pieces.

Falkirk Triniy Church is about a 5 minute walk from Falkirk Grahamston Railway Station, and there is all day parking in the Council Car Parks in Garrison Place East, Garrison Place West, Meeks Road and Bridge Street. There is limited parking at the Church and we woud like to  reserve these spots for those transporting large instruments or those with mobility issues - please see the relevant question in the registration form, as a code is required to enter the Church car park.

Do sign up as soon as you can, particularly if you intend to play, so we can confirm the mix of instruments and appropriate music. The link to the registration form is detailed in the 'more information' box or contact events@emfscotland.org.uk .
