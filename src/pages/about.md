# About EMFS

The Early Music Forum of Scotland (EMFS) brings together singers, players, listeners and instrument makers from around Scotland with an interest in the medieval, renaissance and baroque periods. Our members range from professional to amateur, from singers to players of viols, recorders, sackbutt, cornett and more!

We organise an early music choir, occasional choral and instrumental workshops and coaching weekends, and early music performances in public spaces. Most of our events currently take place in Edinburgh (but we’d love to find people willing to organise events elsewhere in Scotland).

We are a member-run and self-funded voluntary organisation.
